Description: This package implements the G-PFSO (Global Particle Filter Stochastic Optimization) algorithm of Gerber and Douc (2021) for finding the global minimizer of a function defined through an expectation. Informally speaking, G-PFSO can be seen as a particle and derivative-free version of stochastic gradient methods.
